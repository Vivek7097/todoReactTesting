# TodoList React App: Testing with React Testing Library
This repository contains a simple TodoList React app, and I’ve created two test structures to ensure its functionality. Let’s dive into the details:

### `1.App.test.js`
In this test structure, we focus on two key scenarios:

* 1. Adding a New Todo:
     *  We verify that when a new todo is added, it correctly renders within the app.
* 2. Toggling All Todos:
     * We ensure that the “toggle all” checkbox works as expected.

### `2. input.test.js`
This test structure resides within the todo/component/__test__ directory. It specifically checks the input field:
* We validate that the placeholder and label text provided by the headerComponent are correctly displayed.
